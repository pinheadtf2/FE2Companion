# FE2 Companion
A Python project that acts as a tracker & music player for the game [Flood Escape 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/738339342/FLOOD-ESCAPE-2) and [FE2: Community Maps](https://www.roblox.com/games/11951199229/Flood-Escape-2-Community-Maps). This project works by using [Tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)), [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) and other methods to identify strings that appear at the start of rounds, storing records and run information as you play.
